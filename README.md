# DiscordServerCloner
A NodeJS Tool to Clone Discord Servers
I've put a pretty basic obfuscation to it, so enjoy deobfuscating it
## Features
Clones an entire Discord server including the hidden channels
## Requirements
Node.js setup is included in the repository, just install it
Your Discord User token (not a bot token as this is a self-bot)
## Installation & Setup
Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord-server-cloner.git
cd discord-server-cloner
```

Run the file ``run.bat``
